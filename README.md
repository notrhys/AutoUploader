Since this tool uses SSHJ and not JSCH because of stupid issues
you will need to follow a few steps to get this working outside of the IDE

# How to use:
1. double click on start.bat
2. Settings -> FTP Settings
3. enter the FTP server settings you want to upload to
4. click save
5. click start
6. export the plugin you are uploading to the "output" folder
